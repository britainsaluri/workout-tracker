## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This Checkpoint Preserves
✅ Working website code
✅ Complete workout data
✅ Deployment configuration
✅ Documentation state
✅ Swarm analysis findings

### What This Checkpoint Does NOT Preserve
❌ User's workout logs (stored in browser localStorage)
❌ Vercel dashboard settings (manual configuration)
❌ Future deployments
❌ Runtime data

### Recommendations
1. **Test before major changes** - Always verify the checkpoint works
2. **Create new checkpoints** - After successful new features
3. **Document rollbacks** - If you restore, note why
4. **Keep v1.0** - Don't delete the base version
