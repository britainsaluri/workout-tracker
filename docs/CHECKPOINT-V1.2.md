# Workout App Checkpoint v1.2 - Progressive Overload Feature

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Stable & Production Ready
**Purpose**: Progressive overload weight suggestions for Week 2+ workouts

---

## 🎯 Why This Checkpoint?

This checkpoint adds **intelligent weight progression recommendations** to the workout tracker. The app now suggests weights for Week 2 exercises based on Week 1 performance using progressive overload principles.

**User Request**: "I want to use hive-mind and swarm agents to plan how to add a suggested weight amount for the 2nd week of the workouts based on the results from the 1st week. For example if someone did all 20 reps at 145 pounds for 2 sets, the next week of workouts should recommend increasing weight by 10 pounds to 155 pounds."

## ✨ Key Features Demonstration

### Example Scenario

**Week 1 Performance:**
```
Exercise: Barbell Bench Press (A1)
Target: 2x18-20 reps
Results:
- Set 1: 145 lbs × 20 reps ✓
- Set 2: 145 lbs × 20 reps ✓
```

**Week 2 Suggestion:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💡 SUGGESTED WEIGHT        [×]  │
│ 155 lbs (+10 from last week) ✅ │
│ Last week: 145×20, 145×20       │
│ Reason: Hit top of rep range    │
│ [   Accept   ] [  Modify  ]     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After Accept:**
- All 3 weight inputs auto-filled with 155 lbs
- User only needs to enter reps after each set
- Suggestion dismissed automatically

1. **Week 1**: User completes workout, enters weights and reps
2. **Data Saved**: Results stored in localStorage
3. **Week 2**: User navigates to Week 2 workout
4. **Suggestions Appear**: Algorithm calculates recommended weights
5. **User Chooses**:
   - **Accept** → Auto-fills all weight inputs
