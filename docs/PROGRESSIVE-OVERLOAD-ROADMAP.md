# Progressive Overload Implementation Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Target Completion:** 2 weeks (~10-12 business days)
**Status:** Planning Complete ✅

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the implementation of an intelligent progressive overload suggestion system for the workout tracker. The system will analyze Week 1 performance data and provide smart weight recommendations for Week 2 exercises.

**Key Metrics:**
- Development Time: 8-10 days
- Testing Time: 2 days
- Total Timeline: ~2 weeks
- Risk Level: Low-Medium
- Expected Impact: High user value

---

## Agent Findings Consolidation

### 1. Exercise Mapping Analysis (Code Analyzer Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Findings:**
- Week 1 → Week 2 exercise relationships identified
- Current data structure supports progression tracking
- Existing `workoutExercises` table has weight/rep fields
- User-specific workout tracking in place

**Key Mappings:**
```
Week 1 Chest → Week 2 Chest (same exercises, progression needed)
Week 1 Back → Week 2 Back (same exercises, progression needed)
Week 1 Legs → Week 2 Legs (same exercises, progression needed)
```

### 2. Algorithm Design (System Architect Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Core Algorithm:**
```
IF (Week 1 reps >= target_max_reps):
  suggested_weight = Week_1_weight + increment
  confidence = "high"
ELSE IF (Week 1 reps >= target_min_reps):
  suggested_weight = Week_1_weight + (increment / 2)
  confidence = "medium"
ELSE:
  suggested_weight = Week_1_weight (same weight)
  confidence = "low"
```

**Progression Rules:**
- Compound exercises: +10 lbs (bench, squat, deadlift)
- Isolation exercises: +5 lbs (curls, extensions)
- Bodyweight: +1 rep or add weight vest

### 3. Data Model Specification (Backend Developer Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**New Tables Required:**

```sql
-- Table 1: Progressive Overload Suggestions
CREATE TABLE workout_suggestions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  week_1_exercise_id UUID REFERENCES workout_exercises(id),
  week_2_exercise_id UUID REFERENCES workout_exercises(id),
  suggested_weight DECIMAL(5,2),
  confidence_level TEXT CHECK (confidence_level IN ('high', 'medium', 'low')),
  reason TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'ignored')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table 2: Suggestion Feedback
CREATE TABLE suggestion_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  suggestion_id UUID REFERENCES workout_suggestions(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  accepted BOOLEAN,
  actual_weight DECIMAL(5,2),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_suggestions_user_week ON workout_suggestions(user_id, week_2_exercise_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_suggestion ON suggestion_feedback(suggestion_id);
```

### 4. UI Design (Mobile Developer Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Component Structure:**
```
<WeekTwoWorkoutView>
  ├── <ExerciseCard>
  │   ├── <ExerciseInfo>
  │   ├── <ProgressionSuggestion> ← NEW
  │   │   ├── <SuggestionBadge>
  │   │   ├── <ConfidenceIndicator>
  │   │   ├── <ReasonText>
  │   │   └── <ActionButtons>
  │   └── <WeightRepsInput>
```

**User Flow:**
1. User opens Week 2 workout
2. Suggestion badge appears on exercises with recommendations
3. User taps to see details (suggested weight, reason, confidence)
4. User can accept (auto-fills weight) or ignore (manual entry)
5. System tracks acceptance rate for ML training

### 5. Testing Strategy (Test Engineer Agent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests: Algorithm logic (12 test cases)
- Integration tests: API endpoints (8 test cases)
- E2E tests: User workflows (5 test cases)
- Performance tests: Load testing (3 scenarios)
- **Total: 28 test cases**

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Functionality 🔴
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Risk Score:** 7/10

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive test coverage (28 test cases)
- Feature flagging for gradual rollout
- Git checkpoint before deployment (v1.1 → v1.2)
- Staging environment testing
- Rollback plan documented

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
# If critical bug found post-deployment
git revert v1.2-progressive-overload
vercel deploy --prod
# Redeploy previous stable version (v1.1)
```

---

### Risk 2: Poor Suggestions Confuse Users 🟡
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 5/10

**Mitigation:**
- Clear explanations for each suggestion
- Confidence indicators to set expectations
- Optional feature (can be hidden in settings)
- User feedback loop to improve algorithm
- A/B testing with 50% rollout initially

**Monitoring:**
- Track acceptance rate (target: > 50%)
- Track rejection reasons
- Monitor support tickets mentioning "suggestions"
- User surveys after 2 weeks

---

### Risk 3: Performance Degradation 🟡
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Risk Score:** 3/10

**Mitigation:**
- Lazy loading of suggestions (only when Week 2 opened)
- Caching layer (Redis/in-memory)
- Database indexing on queries
- Load testing before production
- Query optimization

**Performance Targets:**
- Suggestion generation: < 200ms
- API response time: < 500ms
- UI render time: < 100ms
- Database query time: < 50ms

---

### Risk 4: Incomplete Week 1 Data 🟢
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low
**Risk Score:** 3/10

**Mitigation:**
- Graceful fallback to conservative suggestions
- Display "Not enough data" message
- Suggest using Week 1 weight as starting point
- Log missing data for analytics

**Handling:**
```typescript
if (!week1Data || !week1Data.weight) {
  return {
    suggestedWeight: null,
    confidence: 'none',
    reason: 'Complete Week 1 to get personalized suggestions'
  };
}
```

---

### Risk 5: Mobile Browser Compatibility 🟢
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Low
**Risk Score:** 2/10

**Mitigation:**
- Test on iOS Safari, Chrome, Firefox
- Test on Android Chrome, Samsung Browser
- Use progressive enhancement (works without JS)
- Polyfills for older browsers
- Responsive design testing (320px - 768px)
