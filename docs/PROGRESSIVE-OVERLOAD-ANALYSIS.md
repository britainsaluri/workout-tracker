## 3. Data Structure Analysis

### Current localStorage Format

**Key Pattern:**
```
sheet1_w{week}_d{day}_{exerciseId}_{setNumber}
```

**Examples:**
- Week 1, Day 1, Exercise A1, Set 1: `sheet1_w1_d1_A1_1`
- Week 1, Day 1, Exercise A1, Set 2: `sheet1_w1_d1_A1_2`
- Week 2, Day 1, Exercise A1, Set 1: `sheet1_w2_d1_A1_1`
- Week 2, Day 1, Exercise A1, Set 2: `sheet1_w2_d1_A1_2`
- Week 2, Day 1, Exercise A1, Set 3: `sheet1_w2_d1_A1_3`

### Week 1 Results Storage

**Sample data from JSON:**
```json
{
  "exercise_id": "A1",
  "exercise_name": "Barbell Bench",
  "results": "105x15,95x10",
  "day": 1,
  "week": 1
}
```

**Parsed format in localStorage:**
```javascript
sheet1_w1_d1_A1_1 = { weight: 105, reps: 15 }
sheet1_w1_d1_A1_2 = { weight: 95, reps: 10 }
```

## 4. Progressive Overload Algorithm

### Weight Suggestion Logic for Week 2

#### Scenario 1: Both Week 1 Sets Completed Successfully
**Condition:** Both sets in target rep range
**Example:** Week 1 → 95x18, 95x15 (both sets 15+ reps)
**Suggestion:** Use 95 lbs for all 3 sets in Week 2
**Display:** `Last week: 95x18, 95x15 → Try: 95 lbs (3 sets)`

#### Scenario 2: Week 1 Sets Used Different Weights
**Condition:** Weight decreased between sets
**Example:** Week 1 → 105x15, 95x10
**Suggestion:** Use second set weight (95) for all 3 sets in Week 2
**Display:** `Last week: 105x15, 95x10 → Try: 95 lbs (3 sets, then progress)`

#### Scenario 3: Week 1 Reps Below Target Range
**Condition:** Both sets completed but reps low
**Example:** Week 1 → 95x12, 95x10 (target: 18-20)
**Suggestion:** Use same weight (95) with note to aim for higher reps
**Display:** `Last week: 95x12, 95x10 → Try: 95 lbs (aim for 15+ reps)`

#### Scenario 4: No Week 1 Data
**Condition:** Exercise was not logged in Week 1
**Suggestion:** No suggestion provided, user enters weight manually
**Display:** Empty input, standard placeholder

## 5. Implementation Requirements

### Frontend Display Features

#### Week 2 Input Field Enhancement

**Option 1: Inline Suggestion**
```
Input field placeholder: "Last week: 95x18, 95x15 → Try: 95"
```

**Option 2: Visual Comparison**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Set 1: [___] lbs x [___] reps      │
│ Set 2: [___] lbs x [___] reps      │
│ Set 3: [___] lbs x [___] reps      │
│                                     │
│ 📊 Week 1: 95x18, 95x15            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Option 3: Autofill Button**
```
[Use Last Week's Weight: 95 lbs] (button)
```

#### Data Retrieval Function

```javascript
function getWeek1Results(exerciseId, day) {
  const week1Results = [];

  for (let setNum = 1; setNum <= 2; setNum++) {
    const key = `sheet1_w1_d${day}_${exerciseId}_${setNum}`;
    const result = localStorage.getItem(key);

    if (result) {
      week1Results.push(JSON.parse(result));
    }
  }

  return week1Results;
}
```

#### Weight Suggestion Function

```javascript
function suggestWeek2Weight(week1Results) {
  if (!week1Results || week1Results.length === 0) {
    return null; // No suggestion
  }

  // Get weights from Week 1
  const weights = week1Results.map(r => r.weight);
  const reps = week1Results.map(r => r.reps);

  // If weights are consistent and reps in range, use that weight
  if (weights.every(w => w === weights[0]) && reps.every(r => r >= 15)) {
    return {
      weight: weights[0],
      confidence: "high",
      message: `Use ${weights[0]} lbs for all 3 sets`
    };
  }

  // If weights vary, use the lower weight
  if (weights[0] !== weights[1]) {
    return {
      weight: Math.min(...weights),
      confidence: "medium",
      message: `Start with ${Math.min(...weights)} lbs, progress as able`
    };
  }

  // Default: use last set weight
  return {
    weight: weights[weights.length - 1],
    confidence: "medium",
    message: `Try ${weights[weights.length - 1]} lbs based on last week`
  };
}
```

## 6. Progressive Overload Tracking Metrics

### Success Indicators for Week 2

1. **Volume Completion:** Did user complete all 3 sets?
2. **Weight Maintenance:** Did user maintain Week 1 weight for 3 sets?
3. **Rep Range Achievement:** Did reps stay within target range?
4. **Total Volume:** Compare total volume (weight × reps × sets)

### Week 1 vs Week 2 Volume Comparison

**Example: Barbell Bench (Day 1, A1)**

**Week 1:**
- Set 1: 105 × 15 = 1,575 lbs
- Set 2: 95 × 10 = 950 lbs
- **Total: 2,525 lbs**

**Week 2:**
- Set 1: 95 × 18 = 1,710 lbs
- Set 2: 95 × 15 = 1,425 lbs
- Set 3: 95 × 12 = 1,140 lbs
- **Total: 4,275 lbs**

**Volume Increase: 69.3%** ✅ (50%+ increase = successful progression)

### Priority 2: Enhanced UX
4. Add one-click "Use Last Week's Weight" button
5. Visual progress indicators (weight/volume trending)
6. Success badges for achieving progressive overload

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
7. Progressive overload calculator (predict Week 3 targets)
8. Deload week detection (automatic weight reduction suggestions)
9. Personal record tracking (highlight PRs in volume/weight/reps)

## 9. Progressive Overload Philosophy

### Program Design Principles

**Week 1-2 Focus:** Volume Acclimation
- Primary stress: Increase set volume (2 → 3 sets)
- Secondary stress: Maintain weight and rep quality
- Goal: Adapt to higher training volume before increasing intensity

**Expected Week 3-4 Progression:**
- Likely: Maintain 3 sets, increase weight by 5-10%
- Or: Maintain 3 sets, increase reps (18-20 → 20-22)
- Or: Decrease rest periods for same work

### Monitoring Progressive Overload Success

**Green Flags (Positive Adaptation):**
- ✅ All 3 sets completed in target rep range
- ✅ Equal or better reps on all sets vs Week 1's 2 sets
- ✅ Maintained or increased weight
- ✅ Form quality maintained throughout

**Yellow Flags (Monitor Closely):**
- ⚠️ Third set significantly lower reps than first two
- ⚠️ Weight decreased from Week 1
- ⚠️ Reps below target range on multiple sets

**Red Flags (Consider Deload):**
- 🚨 Unable to complete 3 sets with acceptable form
- 🚨 Reps significantly below target (>5 reps under minimum)
- 🚨 Multiple exercises showing regression

## 10. Next Steps

### For Development Team

1. **Implement data retrieval logic** for Week 1 results
2. **Create suggestion algorithm** for Week 2 weights
3. **Design UI components** for comparative display
4. **Add progressive overload tracking** metrics
5. **Test with real user data** from Week 1

### For User Experience

1. **Educate users** on progressive overload principles
2. **Provide visual feedback** on volume progression
3. **Celebrate successes** (badges, notifications)
4. **Guide adjustments** when progression stalls
