# Storage Format Test Results

## Test Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Tests Run:** 8
**Passed:** 8
**Failed:** 0
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED

---

## Test Results

### 1. ‚úÖ Storage stores weight and reps separately
- **Input:** `{weight: 20, reps: 10, completed: true}`
- **Stored:** `{weight: 20, reps: 10, completed: true}`
- **Verified:** Weight and reps are stored as separate fields

### 2. ‚úÖ Storage key format matches implementation
- **Key Format:** `sheet1_w1_d1_A1_1`
- **Pattern:** `{program}_w{week}_d{day}_{exerciseId}_{setNumber}`
- **Verified:** Key format is consistent with implementation

### 3. ‚úÖ Sample data from addSampleWeek1Data() format
- **Sample Data:** `{weight: 145, reps: 20, completed: true}`
- **Verified:** Sample data is stored correctly

### 4. ‚úÖ Weight retrieval preserves original values
- **Stored:** 20 lbs √ó 10 reps (3 sets)
- **Retrieved:** `[20, 20, 20]`
- **Verified:** No multiplication during storage/retrieval

### 5. ‚úÖ Weight calculation for suggestion uses correct base weight
- **Average Weight:** 20 lbs
- **Suggested Weight (12.5% increase):** 22.5 lbs
- **Verified:** Calculation is correct when using proper storage data

### 6. ‚úÖ Data types are preserved during storage/retrieval
- **Types Verified:**
  - `weight: number`
  - `reps: number`
  - `completed: boolean`

### 7. ‚úÖ Bug simulation scenario
- **User Input:** 20 lbs √ó 10 reps
- **Stored Weight:** 20 (NOT 200)
- **Verified:** Storage layer does NOT multiply weight √ó reps

### 8. ‚úÖ Multiple sets retrieval pattern
- **Retrieved:** 3 sets with weight=20, reps=10
- **Average:** 20 lbs
- **Verified:** All sets preserve original values

## Bug Analysis

### ‚úÖ Storage Layer is CORRECT
The storage layer (`/src/storage.js` and `/src/index.html`) is working correctly:
- Data is stored as: `{weight: 20, reps: 10}`
- Data is retrieved as: `{weight: 20, reps: 10}`
- No multiplication occurs during storage or retrieval
- All data types are preserved

### ‚ùå Bug is NOT in Storage Layer
The bug causing "200 lbs instead of 22.5 lbs" is **NOT** in:
- `/src/storage.js` - Storage abstraction layer
- `/src/index.html` - Workout logging section (lines 916-966)
- localStorage operations

### üêõ Bug is Likely in These Files:
1. **`/src/utils/weightSuggestions.js`**
   - `getWeek1Results()` - May be incorrectly calculating weight
   - `calculateSuggestion()` - May be using wrong base value

2. **`/src/ui/suggestionCard.js`**
   - `getSuggestionForExercise()` - May be processing data incorrectly

## Data Flow Analysis

```
User Input: 20 lbs √ó 10 reps
    ‚Üì
Storage: {weight: 20, reps: 10} ‚úÖ CORRECT
    ‚Üì
Retrieval: {weight: 20, reps: 10} ‚úÖ CORRECT
    ‚Üì
??? Bug occurs here ???
    ‚Üì
Display: 200 lbs (WRONG - should be 22.5 lbs)
```

### Expected Flow:
```
Week 1 Results: [20, 20, 20] lbs
    ‚Üì
Average: 20 lbs
    ‚Üì
Suggestion (12.5% increase): 22.5 lbs ‚úÖ
```

### Actual Flow (Bug):
```
Week 1 Results: ??? [Possibly 200, 200, 200] ???
    ‚Üì
Average: 200 lbs
    ‚Üì
Suggestion (12.5% increase): 220 lbs ‚ùå
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Examine `/src/utils/weightSuggestions.js`
Check the `getWeek1Results()` function:
```javascript
// Hypothesis: Is it multiplying weight √ó reps?
const results = [];
// Loop through Week 1 sets
// Check if results.push(weight * reps) instead of results.push(weight)
```

### 2. Examine `/src/ui/suggestionCard.js`
Check the `getSuggestionForExercise()` function:
```javascript
// Hypothesis: Is it processing the retrieved data incorrectly?
const week1Results = getWeek1Results(...);
// Check how week1Results is used
```

### 3. Add Debug Logging
Add console.log statements to track data transformation:
```javascript
console.log('Week 1 stored data:', rawData);
console.log('Week 1 processed results:', processedResults);
console.log('Average weight:', avgWeight);
console.log('Suggested weight:', suggestedWeight);
```

## Test Files Created

1. **`/tests/storage-format-test.js`** (465 lines)
   - Comprehensive test suite for storage format
   - 8 test cases covering all storage scenarios
   - Mock localStorage implementation
   - Detailed bug analysis

2. **`/tests/STORAGE_TEST_RESULTS.md`** (this file)
   - Test results summary
   - Bug analysis
   - Next steps for debugging

## Conclusion

**Storage layer is working correctly.** The bug causing weight suggestions to show 200 lbs instead of 22.5 lbs is occurring in the weight suggestion calculation logic, specifically in:
- `/src/utils/weightSuggestions.js`
- `/src/ui/suggestionCard.js`

The next agent should examine these files to identify where `weight * reps` is being calculated instead of using just `weight`.
