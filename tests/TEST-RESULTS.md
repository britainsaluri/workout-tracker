- `contains()` - String/array inclusion
- `notNull()` / `isNull()` - Null checks
- `throws()` - Exception handling
- `isTrue()` / `isFalse()` - Boolean checks
- `deepEqual()` - Object comparison
- `report()` - Test summary generation

### Mock Objects

Created `MockLocalStorage` class:
- Full localStorage API compatibility
- In-memory storage
